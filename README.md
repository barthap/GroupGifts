### About
An old simple app created to help calculate debts when buying gifts together.
I used to have a group of friends and we bought each other birthday gifts together, but there was always a problem with money. We didn't know who owes money and how much. This simple app helped us a lot.
Written in 2016

_**NOTE:** I didn't know about Splitwise when I was developing this app_

It has three versions:
- Web (jQuery)
- C# .NET Windows Forms
- Others: *C++, Java and Python* (only logic part, written for practice)

### Demo (PL):
Live jQuery demo is available [here](https://hapex.com.pl/demos/jquery-gifts/). Currently only available in Polish.

### TODO:
Rewrite everything to English and improve coding practices
